# Bank-Management
This project is divided into three key roles: Admin, Customer, and Staff, each with distinct authorization levels:

## 1. Customer: 
Can perform transactions and other related operations.
## 2. Staff: 
Responsible for adding or deducting amounts in accounts and submitting requests to open new accounts.
## 3. Admin: 
Has complete oversight of all accounts, including the ability to view, read, and manage account credentials. Admin can also approve requests to open accounts.

### The system ensures role-based access control to maintain security and operational integrity.
