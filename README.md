# Bank-Management
This project is divided into three key roles: Admin, Customer, and Staff, each with distinct authorization levels:

Customer: Can perform transactions and other related operations.
Staff: Responsible for adding or deducting amounts in accounts and submitting requests to open new accounts.
Admin: Has complete oversight of all accounts, including the ability to view, read, and manage account credentials. Admin can also approve requests to open accounts.
The system ensures role-based access control to maintain security and operational integrity.
